"""Shelf tool handlers for FXHoudini-MCP.

Some of Houdini's most useful setups are not authored by node creation at all:
they are shelf tools. The ocean procedural is the clear case -- its internals come
from ``dopparticlefluidtoolutils.largeOcean``, so build_network structurally
cannot produce it. A recorded session spent seven execute_python calls listing
shelf tools, reading their scripts and calling the worker functions by hand, every
one of them noting that no dedicated tool exposes any of this.

Reading the script matters as much as running it: SideFX's own recipe for a
horizon-scale ocean (layered spectra on an 8km grid, so the waves do not visibly
tile) lives in that script, and it is the difference between a fire-shaped blob
and the real thing.
