"""hwebserver endpoint registration for the FXHoudini-MCP plugin.

Registers API functions on Houdini's built-in HTTP server that the
external MCP server communicates with over HTTP.

Calling convention (JSON-encoded RPC):
    POST /api
    Body: json=["mcp.execute", [], {"command": "...", "params": {...}, "request_id": "..."}]

Responses are JSON-encoded here rather than left to hwebserver, so that a
value HOM cannot serialise degrades instead of collapsing into an opaque 500.
