"""Generate the whole node-domain section of server_instructions.md.

Every node name advertised to the assistant is derived here. Nothing in that
section is hand-written, so there is no half-curated, half-generated boundary for
a reader to guess at.

    python tools/gen_node_domains.py            # regenerate
    python tools/gen_node_domains.py --check    # fail if stale

Version markers are written here, from tools/node_versions.json, so one run
leaves a correct file. This script used to emit bare names and depend on
tools/gen_node_versions.py running afterwards to add them, which meant running
it alone quietly stripped every marker and told 20.5 users about 22.0-only
nodes. Run gen_node_versions.py to contribute a build to that table; it is no
longer a required second step here.

Sources, and why each:

* SideFX's shipped node help (``nodes.zip``) decides which names appear. It is
  the only signal available for "ships with Houdini": the installed node lists
  include whatever plugins are on the generating machine, and advertising one
  studio's Redshift or Octane nodes to every user would manufacture exactly the
  hallucinations this section exists to prevent. Verified: redshift:: and
  octane_ are absent from the help.
* ``#tags`` supply the grouping where SideFX populated them, which in practice
  means SOPs and DOPs. Elsewhere they are near-empty (3 tagged VOPs out of 1257,
  0 COPs, 0 SHOPs), so those contexts fall back to name stems usable as a
  ``filter=`` value, then to a flat list of names.
* ``tools/node_versions.json`` decides what exists at all, from the builds
  contributors have sampled.

Known limitation, stated in the generated text as well: the help documents 3974
nodes against 5566 installed on a full 22.0 install, so real stock nodes SideFX
never documented (surfacedeform, deflate, wrinkledeformer) are absent. The lists
are a floor, not an inventory, which is why the generated preamble points at
list_node_types and search_help.
