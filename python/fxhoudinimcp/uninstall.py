"""Take both halves back out again.

``install`` writes into two places that outlive the Python package: a Houdini
packages directory, and an MCP client's config. ``pip uninstall`` moves neither,
so removing this used to mean knowing where both live and editing them by hand.

The leftovers are not harmless, and they fail in the quiet way this project
keeps running into. A package file pointing at a plugin directory that no longer
exists is skipped by Houdini without a word. A client entry pointing at a
removed interpreter surfaces only as "disconnected". And a forgotten
``fxhoudinimcp.json`` in a second packages directory silently overrides the next
install, because Houdini processes every packages directory and the last one
wins.

    fxhoudinimcp uninstall                    # remove both halves, after asking
    fxhoudinimcp uninstall --dry-run          # list what it would remove
    fxhoudinimcp uninstall --yes              # do not ask
    fxhoudinimcp uninstall --houdini-dir DIR  # only this packages directory
    fxhoudinimcp uninstall --client none      # leave client configs alone

Unlike ``install``, this does not have to pick between candidate directories.
Installing has to know which Houdini you mean; removing does not, because every
``fxhoudinimcp.json`` found is a leftover and leaving one behind is the hazard
above. So the default is all of them, listed in full before anything is deleted.

The Python package is deliberately left alone. That is ``pip uninstall
fxhoudinimcp``, and running it on someone's behalf from inside the package being
removed is a good way to produce a half-deleted install.
