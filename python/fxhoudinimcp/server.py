        "- Call log_status at the start of every major step so the user can "
        "follow your work in Houdini's status bar in real time. Examples: "
        "'Creating base geometry...', 'Wiring SOP chain...', "
        "'Setting up pyro simulation...', 'Assigning materials...'. "
        "This costs almost nothing and is the user's only live feedback.\n\n"
        "TOOL PRIORITY for geometry (highest to lowest):\n"
        "  1. Workflow tools — build_sop_chain, setup_pyro_sim, setup_rbd_sim, "
        "setup_flip_sim, setup_vellum_sim. These build entire networks in ONE "
        "call. Always prefer them over building node-by-node.\n"
        "  2. Native SOP nodes via create_node + connect_nodes_batch — box, "
        "grid, sphere, polyextrude, boolean, scatter, copy_to_points, "
        "attribute_randomize, blast, transform, polybevel, mountain, etc. "
        "Use set_parameters (plural, batch) to set multiple params in one call.\n"
        "  3. VEX wrangles via create_wrangle — ONLY when no built-in SOP can "
        "express the logic. NOT for shapes, copies, random attributes, or "
        "boolean operations — those all have dedicated SOP nodes.\n"
        "  4. execute_python — ONLY for scene-level scripting where no dedicated "
        "tool exists at all. Never use it for geometry manipulation.\n\n"
        "- build_sop_chain takes a list of steps and wires them all at once. "
        "Prefer it over individual create_node calls for linear SOP chains.\n"
        "- Before writing ANY VEX, ask: does a SOP node already do this? "
        "Call list_node_types with context='Sop' to check.\n"
        "- NEVER hardcode tweakable values. Create a controller null ('CTRL') "
        "with spare parameters for user-facing controls.\n"
        "- Call layout_children after every batch of nodes, not just at the end.\n"
        "- When a workflow tool exists (setup_pyro_sim, setup_rbd_sim, etc.), "
        "use it instead of building from scratch."
