"""Emit the Houdini package file that points at the installed plugin.

The plugin now ships inside this package, so its path depends on which Python
you installed into. That path is easy to get wrong and easy to break: recreate a
venv, switch to uv or pipx, move from 3.11 to 3.12, and a hand-typed path
silently stops resolving. Houdini says nothing when a package path is missing, it
just skips the file, which is what made issue #11 so confusing.

So nobody should type it. This resolves the path from the running interpreter and
prints, or writes, the JSON.

    fxhoudinimcp houdini-package                 # print the JSON and where to put it
    fxhoudinimcp houdini-package --write DIR     # write it into DIR

The destination is not guessed. Houdini's preference directory is genuinely
ambiguous on Windows, where OneDrive's Documents redirection means a
desktop-launched Houdini and a shell-launched one can disagree, so candidates are
listed and the choice is left to the operator.
