You are setting up a pyro simulation in Houdini (smoke, fire, explosions).

Goal: {description}

SideFX documents this workflow properly. `pyro/lookdev` is the workflow page,
`pyro/sparsity` explains sparse solving and resizing, `pyro/clustering` covers
multiple sources, `pyro/advanced` covers instanced pyro. Read the relevant one
with get_help_page rather than improvising, and use setup_pyro_sim to build the
network instead of wiring DOPs by hand.

## Voxel size is the whole cost model

**Voxel Size sets resolution: lower is finer, and it must be set relative to the
scale of the effect.** The default `0.1` suits an explosion with a unit-sized
base. If the base is 100 units across, Voxel Size has to go up to match, or the
sim is pointlessly expensive. Deliberately work at a large voxel size while
establishing behaviour, and only go finer once the motion is approved.

The corollary that catches people: **detail smaller than the voxel size does not
exist.** Shredding and turbulence you cannot see are not a shaping problem, they
are a resolution problem.

Two more settings to get right once and then leave alone:

- **Max Timesteps** on the solver. Default `1` is enough for smoke; raise it when the fluid moves fast.
- **Padding** is the free space the solver keeps around the smoke. It must be big enough to hold the motion inside one timestep, and making it too large slows the sim.

Use the __Domain__ visualisation under Guides > Visualization to see where the
sim actually takes place before paying for it.

## Bulk motion first, shape operators second

Get the bulk shape and movement right before adding any detail. The solver has
four built-in shape operators, and they are not interchangeable:

- **Dissipation** reduces density over time so smoke fades. On a sparse sim, set __Clamp Below__ properly, or tiny leftover density values linger and inflate the active region, which you pay for every frame.
- **Disturbance** applies linear accelerations. This is the one for breaking up smooth smoke caps.
- **Shredding** rotates velocities instead, adding chaos without speeding the flow up or slowing it down. Fire especially wants this: without shredding, fire is dominated by vertical licks.
- **Turbulence** adds large-scale noise to velocities.

Each has an enable checkbox and a strength scale. Each also takes a **Control
Field**, fitted from __Control Range__ into 0-1 and optionally remapped through
__Control Ramp__, then multiplied onto the global strength. That is how you mask
a shaping operator to a region instead of applying it everywhere, and reaching
for a control field rather than a global value is the difference between shaping
and smearing.

## Failure signatures (these are SideFX's own, from `pyro/lookdev`)

- **Staircase artifacts in a sparse sim.** Insufficient padding. Raise Max Substeps and/or Padding on the Advanced tab.
- **Noticeable streaks with fast sources or fast motion.** Insufficient substepping. Raise Max Substeps.
- **Smoke ignoring collision geometry.** Raise __IOP Iterations__ under Advanced > Collisions.
- **Thin axis-aligned streaks of smoke.** Enable hourglass filtering, Advanced > Hourglass Filtering.
- **Peak memory too high.** Sparse solvers advect in batches, which raises peak usage. Cap it with Advanced > Advection > Max Batch Size.
- **Disturbance looks noisy rather than turbulent.** Continuous mode adds independent noise at every voxel, so at a small voxel size it degenerates into noise. Continuous suits avalanche-like effects, not everything.
- **Vortices dying out.** Advection-Reflection. Single-Project is cheap; Double-Project preserves vortices best but effectively doubles the substeps and costs accordingly. Disable it for anything using the `divergence` field, explosions included, which is the safest setting there.

## Judgement worth having

- **Time Scale is animatable**, and a high value at the start of an explosion is how you catch the violent initial blast without paying for it over the whole shot.
- Custom forces attach as microsolvers to the solver's **Forces** input. That is the extension point; it is not a reason to write a wrangle.
- Sparse is not a synonym for cheap. `pyro/sparsity` explains what the active region is and how resizing works, and a sim that fails to shrink its active region is usually a dissipation clamp problem, not a solver problem.
- Many sources means clustering, not one enormous container. See `pyro/clustering`.

## Order of work

1. Build and inspect the source. `get_geometry_info` on it before simulating: a sim of empty geometry wastes the whole cook.
2. setup_pyro_sim, then set Voxel Size for the scale of the effect, coarse to begin with.
3. `cook_frame_range(node_path, start, end, attribs=['density'], volumes=True)` over a short range. Read the per-frame active voxel counts and value ranges: that is how you know it is producing fire rather than cooking empty. Then `capture_screenshot` and LOOK. Bulk motion only, no shaping yet.
4. Add shape operators one at a time, masked with control fields where they should be local.
5. `get_sim_memory_usage` before committing to a longer or finer cook, and `reset_simulation` after changing anything fundamental.
6. End in a cache. pyropostprocess shapes the look afterwards, and pyrobakevolume bakes the result for rendering.
