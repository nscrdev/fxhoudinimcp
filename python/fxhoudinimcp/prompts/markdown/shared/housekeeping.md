## Network housekeeping (ALWAYS follow these)

- Call `log_status` at the start of every major step, so the user follows your work in Houdini's status bar instead of reading tool logs. Keep it short: "Creating source geometry...", "Wiring SOP chain...", "Done, display flag set on output node." It costs almost nothing and is the user's only live feedback.
- Call `set_current_network` on the parent you are building in, BEFORE creating nodes and again whenever you change network level, so your work stays visible in the network editor.
