Network housekeeping (ALWAYS follow these):
- Call set_current_network on the parent network you are building in so the
  user can see your work in the network editor. Do this BEFORE you start
  creating nodes, and again whenever you move to a different network level.
- Call layout_children frequently — after every batch of 3-5 new nodes, not
  just at the end. A tidy graph lets the user follow along in real time.

    """Guide for building a procedural modeling network in SOPs.

    Args:
        description: What geometry to create (e.g. "a rocky terrain with scattered trees")
        output_context: Where to create the geo container
    """
    return f"""You are building procedural geometry in Houdini SOPs.

Goal: {description}
Output context: {output_context}

Workflow:
1. Use get_scene_info to understand the current scene state.
2. Create a Geometry container node in {output_context} using create_node.
3. Inside the geo node, build a SOP network:
   - Start with a base shape (box, grid, sphere, etc.)
   - Chain modifier nodes (transform, mountain, scatter, etc.)
   - Use Attribute Wrangles for custom VEX when needed (create_wrangle tool)
   - For complex logic, prefer VEX wrangles over Python SOPs
4. Set the display flag on the final node using set_node_flags.
5. Use get_geometry_info to verify the result.
6. Use layout_children to clean up the network.

VEX Wrangle rules (IMPORTANT):
- After EVERY create_wrangle or set_wrangle_code call, IMMEDIATELY call
  validate_vex on the node to catch compilation errors before anything else.
  Do NOT rely on get_geometry_info to detect VEX problems — it won't show
  syntax errors, only the (empty/stale) geometry output.
- Channel references from a SOP wrangle to spare parameters on the parent
  Geometry node use ONE level up: ch("../parm_name") or chs("../parm_name").
  Two levels (../../) escapes to /obj which is almost always wrong.
  When in doubt, use absolute paths: ch("/obj/geo_name/parm_name").
- Detail-mode wrangles ("Run Over: Detail") can create geometry from scratch
  with addpoint() / addprim() — they do NOT need input geometry. Never add a
  dummy input point just to make a Detail wrangle work.
- VEX ch()/chi()/chf() return 0 silently when the channel path is wrong.
  If a loop produces 0 iterations, the channel path is likely incorrect —
  verify the path, don't restructure the approach.

Debugging strategy — avoid loops:
- If something doesn't work after 2 attempts, STOP and change strategy:
  1. Call validate_vex to check for VEX compilation errors.
  2. Use execute_python to directly inspect live parameter values, e.g.
     hou.parm("/obj/geo/parm").eval(), to confirm channels resolve.
  3. Check find_error_nodes to see if upstream nodes have errors.
- Do NOT keep re-running get_geometry_info hoping for different results.
- Do NOT add workarounds (dummy inputs, extra nodes) for problems you
  haven't diagnosed — find the root cause first.

Efficiency tips:
- Use create_spare_parameters (plural) to batch-create all spare parameters in
  one call, with an optional folder_name to group them in a tab.
  Do NOT call create_spare_parameter 15 times — batch them.
- Use connect_nodes_batch to wire multiple node pairs in one call instead of
  calling connect_nodes repeatedly.
- Use set_viewport_direction to switch to front/top/perspective views.

General tips:
- Check node cooking errors with get_node_info after creating nodes
- Use list_node_types with context="Sop" to discover available node types
- Paginate point data with get_points (start/count) for large geometry
- Use get_parameter_schema to understand node parameters before setting them

    """
    return f"""You are building a USD scene in Houdini's Solaris (LOPs).

Goal: {scene_description}

Workflow:
1. Use get_scene_info to check the current state.
2. Navigate to the /stage context.
3. Build the LOP network:
   - Use create_lop_node for common operations (Camera, Light, Material, Xform)
   - For geometry references, use "Reference" or "Sublayer" LOP nodes
   - For materials, use MaterialX or Karma material networks
4. Connect nodes in a linear chain (LOPs are typically top-to-bottom).
5. Use get_stage_info to inspect the resulting USD stage.
6. Use list_usd_prims to verify the prim hierarchy.
7. Use get_usd_materials to verify material bindings.

Key concepts:
- LOPs build a USD stage layer by layer
- Each LOP node adds its edit to the active layer
- Use get_usd_layers to understand the layer stack
- Use get_usd_composition to inspect references, payloads, and variants
- The display flag determines which node's output is viewed

Goal: {description or f"Create a {sim_type} simulation"}

Workflow:
1. Start with source geometry in SOPs (create a geo node with the source shape).
2. Create a DOP network for the simulation:
   - For Pyro: use Pyro Solver, Smoke Object, source nodes
   - For FLIP: use FLIP Solver, FLIP Object, particle source
   - For RBD: use Bullet/RBD Solver, RBD Packed Object
   - For Vellum: use Vellum Solver, Vellum Source

3. Wire the source geometry into the DOP network.
4. Use get_simulation_info to check the simulation state.
5. Use step_simulation to advance and test.
6. Use get_dop_object to inspect simulation objects.
7. Adjust solver parameters with set_parameter.

Tips:
- Verify geometry source with get_geometry_info before simulation
- Use reset_simulation when changing fundamental parameters
- Check get_sim_memory_usage for large simulations
- Use list_node_types with context="Dop" to discover available node types

Systematic debug workflow:

5. Check parameter values: get_parameter_schema and get_parameter.
6. If geometry issues: get_geometry_info on the problematic node and its inputs.

- Wrong parameter values: compare with get_parameter_schema defaults
- Cooking errors: check upstream nodes first (data flows top to bottom)
- Memory issues: get_sim_memory_usage, get_geometry_info for polygon counts
