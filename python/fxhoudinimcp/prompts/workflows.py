"""MCP prompt templates for common Houdini workflows.

These prompts guide AI assistants through multi-step Houdini tasks.

Markdown filenames follow SideFX's own help scope names, so ``pyro.md`` is the
prompt for the corpus at ``pyro/`` and ``solaris.md`` for ``solaris/``. That
keeps one obvious home per subject and makes the "read the shipped page" advice
inside each prompt checkable. Files starting with an underscore are shared
includes rather than prompts. The public prompt function names predate the
convention and are deliberately unchanged, because clients call them.
