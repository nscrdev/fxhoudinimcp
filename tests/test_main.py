"""Tests for the module entry point.

This file exists because of one bug, and the bug is worth writing down. The
entry point used to match its subcommands by name and let everything else fall
through to ``mcp.run(transport="stdio")``. So on any version predating a given
subcommand, typing it started an MCP server instead:

    $ python -m fxhoudinimcp install
    WARNING:fxhoudinimcp.server:Cannot reach Houdini at startup: ...
    WARNING:fxhoudinimcp.server:Tools will attempt to connect on first use.

Nothing was installed, nothing said so, and the process sat there holding stdin.
It reads as a hung installer, and the two warnings send you looking at Houdini,
which is the one part that was never involved. A typo produced the same thing.

So the contract is now explicit in both directions, and both directions are
tested: no arguments starts the server, because every MCP client depends on
that, and anything unrecognised exits non-zero without importing the server.
