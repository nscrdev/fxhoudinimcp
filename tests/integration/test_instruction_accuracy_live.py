"""Verify the node names advertised in server_instructions.md exist.

The instructions tell assistants to trust specific built-in node names
(the COMMONLY MISSED NODE DOMAINS lists). Any name that does not exist
in this Houdini version is guidance that makes the assistant hallucinate.

Some names only exist in part of the supported range -- Houdini 21 added a lot
of Copernicus, and 22 renamed the LOP ``instancer`` to ``copytopoints`` and
``layout`` to ``paintinstances`` (per the 22.0 Solaris release notes; neither
was dropped, and Houdini keeps the old names as aliases so old scenes load).
Those carry an inline version annotation in the markdown, e.g.
``colorcorrect (21.0+)`` or ``instancer (20.5-21.0)``, and
this test holds each name to its declared range. The annotation is written for
the assistant to read as well, so the markdown stays the single source of
truth rather than duplicating a table here.
