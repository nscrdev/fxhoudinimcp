"""Every command that takes a node path must reject one that does not resolve.

This test discovers its own cases: it walks the handler registry, finds each
command with a path-like parameter, and calls it with a path that cannot exist. A
command added tomorrow is covered tomorrow, without anyone remembering to add a
table entry -- which is the failure mode that let six false-success bugs ship
behind 188/188 command coverage.

The property is narrow and absolute. Given a path that does not resolve, a handler
must not report success, and its message must name the path. Both halves matter:

* not reporting success is what stops a caller building on a result that describes
  nothing -- get_top_network_info returned "top_node_count: 0, cook_state:
  unknown" for a box SOP, which reads as an empty TOP network;
* naming the path is what turns a retry into a fix. "Node not found" alone leaves
  a caller guessing which of the four paths it passed was wrong.

Bespoke wrong-input cases (unknown enum values, missing files, bad ranges) live in
test_failure_paths_live.py. This file is only about path resolution, because that
is the one failure every one of these commands shares.
